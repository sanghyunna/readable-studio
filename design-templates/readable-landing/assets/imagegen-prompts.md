# Atelier Zero ??Image Generation Prompt Pack

This pack is consumed by the `readable-landing` skill. Every page-level
image is rendered with `gpt-image-fal` (preferred) or `gpt-image-azure`.

The pack has three layers:

1. **Style anchor** ??the long block that tells the model what
   universe we are in. Always prepend to every prompt.
2. **Variable slots** ??the per-render content (subject, motifs,
   accent, page type).
3. **Per-slot variants** ??explicit composition templates for hero,
   about, capabilities, method tiles, lab cards, work cards,
   testimonial, and CTA.

Render at 1024횞1024 minimum for square slots (hero / about / capabilities
/ testimonial / cta), 816횞816 for the four method tiles, and 768횞1024 for
portrait slots (lab cards, featured work). Authoritative per-slot
dimensions and aspect ratios live in `image-manifest.json` ??treat that
file as the source of truth. Save as PNG to `assets/<slot>.png`.

## 1. Style anchor (always prepend)

```text
Use case: ads-marketing

Asset type: editorial website hero / creative studio landing page visual

Primary request: Generate a refined editorial web page composition in the
same visual language as a high-end creative AI research studio.

Style/medium: sophisticated digital collage, modern Swiss editorial layout,
Bauhaus geometric composition, classical plaster sculpture fragments,
brutalist/minimal architecture, art-direction website mockup, premium
agency aesthetic.

Scene/backdrop: warm off-white handmade paper background with subtle
grain, faint vertical folds, scanned paper fibers, lightly aged print
texture, thin drafting lines and registration marks.

Subject: a surreal collage combining a cropped classical plaster head or
face fragment, abstract architectural blocks, archways or stairs, sky
cutouts, one small human figure, a delicate tree or botanical element,
and geometric color planes.

Composition/framing: wide 16:9 web page layout, strong asymmetrical
grid, generous negative space, large typography area on the left or
top-left, collage focal object on the right or center-right, precise
alignment, thin divider lines, small UI navigation details.

Lighting/mood: soft diffused daylight, museum-like calm, intelligent,
restrained, tactile, poetic, premium, research-driven.

Color palette: warm ivory, stone beige, soft concrete gray, deep black
text, muted charcoal, washed coral-red accent, occasional mustard-yellow
accent, pale sky blue only inside small sky/image cutouts.

Materials/textures: matte plaster, limestone, travertine, concrete, rough
torn paper edges, halftone print grain, translucent vellum-like overlays,
fine grid paper, dotted matrix patterns.

Typography: large clean grotesk sans-serif for main headline, elegant
high-contrast italic serif for emphasized words, tiny uppercase coral
labels, compact UI microcopy. Text must be crisp, readable, and spelled
exactly as provided.

Graphic details: thin hairline circles, partial arcs, crosshair marks,
small black dots, dotted grids, fine coordinate lines, numbered
annotations, small arrow buttons, simple pill buttons, minimal logo mark.

Constraints: preserve a high-end editorial web design feel; keep spacing
elegant and uncluttered; no cartoon style; no neon colors; no glossy 3D;
no busy gradients; no generic stock-photo look.

Avoid: distorted typography, misspelled text, extra random words, heavy
shadows, childish illustration, cyberpunk, saturated purple/blue palette,
plastic materials, overly decorative UI cards, cluttered composition,
low-resolution textures, watermarks.

## 3. Per-slot composition templates

### `hero.png` ??1:1 (1024횞1024)

```text
Composition/framing: left half is intentionally empty/quiet to allow real
HTML headline overlay; right half holds a tall surreal collage of a
cropped classical plaster head with the top sliced open, sky/architecture
cutouts visible inside the head, a delicate young tree growing through
the composition, a coral sun disk behind, a mustard accent ring at the
base, hairline coordinate marks and dotted matrices around it, a small
human figure standing for scale in the lower-left of the image. Page
type: hero landing.
```

### `about.png` ??1:1 (1024횞1024)

```text

profile head facing right, with an open archway carved through the
torso, sky cutout inside the arch, a tree seedling growing out of the
shoulder, and a coral half-circle behind the head. Tiny dotted hairlines
trace contours. Strong negative space top-left for a side-note overlay.
Page type: about / manifesto plate.
```

## 4. English project input template

Use this template for default project copy. Keep verbatim text short and readable.

```text
Create a 16:9 landscape web visual for a premium creative AI studio: modern Swiss editorial typography, Bauhaus geometry, classical plaster-sculpture collage, minimal architecture, handmade-paper texture, and fine engineering-drawing marks.

Brand: "<brand name>"
Navigation: "<nav 1>", "<nav 2>", "<nav 3>", "<nav 4>"
Label: "<label>"
Render this headline verbatim: "<headline>"
Emphasis word (italic serif): "<emphasis>"
Render this body copy verbatim: "<body>"
Buttons: "<button 1>", "<button 2>"

Subject: <subject description>
Elements: <sky / stone / plants / people / eyes / mountains / water / UI captures>
Composition: <copy left, art right / copy right, art left / headline over horizontal cards / centered collage / timeline columns>
Palette: warm ivory paper, black type, lime or concrete gray, charcoal, a restrained coral accent, and occasional mustard or pale sky blue.

Constraints: legible text, no extra copy, no watermark, no cartoon style, no neon, no heavy shadows, and no generic blue-purple technology gradient.
```

## 5. Calling convention

Pseudocode for an agent driver:

```ts
for (const slot of imageManifest.slots) {
  const prompt = [
    STYLE_ANCHOR,
    fillVars(VARIABLE_SLOTS, brand),
    PER_SLOT[slot.id],
  ].join('\n\n');

  await gptImageFal({
    prompt,
    width:  slot.width,
    height: slot.height,
    quality: 'high',
    output: `assets/${slot.id}.png`,
  });
}
```

If `gpt-image-fal` is unavailable, the same prompts work with
`gpt-image-azure` ??but mask-based inpainting is azure-only.
