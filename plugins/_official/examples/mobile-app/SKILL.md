# Mobile App Skill

Produce a single mobile-app screen mockup, framed inside a real-feeling iPhone 15 Pro device.

## Resource map

```
mobile-app/
?쒋?? SKILL.md                ??you're reading this
?쒋?? assets/
??  ?붴?? template.html       ??seed: device frame + screen primitives (READ FIRST)
?붴?? references/
    ?쒋?? layouts.md          ??6 screen archetypes (Feed / Detail / Onboarding / Profile / Checkout / Focus)
    ?붴?? checklist.md        ??P0/P1/P2 self-review (anti-fake-device)
```

## Workflow

### Step 0 ??Pre-flight

1. **Read `assets/template.html`** end-to-end through the `<style>` block. The Dynamic Island, status bar SVG icons, home indicator, side rails, and tab bar are all already drawn in HTML/SVG ??do not re-implement them inline on each screen.
2. **Read `references/layouts.md`** so you know which 6 archetypes exist.
3. **Read the active DESIGN.md** ??map its tokens to the six `:root` variables in the seed.

### Step 1 ??Copy the seed

Copy `assets/template.html` to the project root as `index.html`. Replace the six `:root` variables with the active design system's tokens. Replace the page `<title>` and the caption above the device.

### Step 2 ??Pick exactly one archetype

| Brief language | Use |
|---|---|
| feed, inbox, timeline, list, messages, notifications | A ??Feed |
| article, post, item, recipe, song, product, song detail | B ??Detail |
| sign-up, welcome, intro, walkthrough, tour | C ??Onboarding |
| profile, account, user page, someone's bio | D ??Profile |
| checkout, payment, order, form, settings step | E ??Checkout |
| timer, map, dashboard widget, single big number | F ??Focus / hero card |

A mobile screen does **one job**. If the brief seems to combine two, ship one screen and offer the other as a follow-up.

### Step 3 ??Paste and fill

Copy the archetype block from `layouts.md` into `<main class="content">`, replacing the placeholder card. Fill bracketed text with real, specific copy from the brief. **Drop the `<nav class="tabbar">` block entirely** for archetypes that don't show one (B, C, E).

### Step 4 ??Self-check

Run through `references/checklist.md`. Pay extra attention to:
- Frame still has the Dynamic Island, status bar SVGs, and home indicator
- Tap targets ??44px
- One accent, used ??2횞 on the screen
- Display headings still use `var(--font-display)` (serif)

### Step 5 ??Emit the artifact

```
<artifact identifier="mobile-slug" type="text/html" title="Mobile ??Screen Name">
<!doctype html>
<html>...</html>
</artifact>
```

One sentence before describing what's there. Stop after `</artifact>`.

## Hard rules

- **The phone is real.** Dynamic Island gap, SVG status icons, home indicator. The seed protects all three ??don't rewrite the frame.
- **Single screen, single job.** No multi-tab tours, no spliced flows.
- **Accent budget = 2.** One active tab + one primary action is the default.
- **Numerics in mono** via `.num` class.
- **Display in serif** via `var(--font-display)`.
- **No external images** ??use `.ph-img` placeholders.
